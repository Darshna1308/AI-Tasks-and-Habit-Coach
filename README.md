# AI-Tasks-and-Habit-Coach
AI Tasks and Habit Coach is a generative‑AI–powered web app that helps students turn their goals into clear, day‑wise action plans.
Instead of manually deciding what to do each day, the user enters goals, available days and time, and the app generates a structured routine with small tasks, breaks and motivation, acting like a personal productivity coach.
​The system uses the OpenAI API to generate personalized plans based on carefully designed prompts.
Through prompt engineering, the AI is instructed to behave as an academic planner, prioritize important or weak areas, and return step‑by‑step schedules instead of generic advice.
​Key ideas shown in this project are:
Using a large language model as a task and habit coach for students.
​Converting high‑level goals into daily micro‑tasks that are actually achievable.
​Demonstrating how prompt design can control AI behaviour (planning, prioritizing, adding breaks, structuring output).
